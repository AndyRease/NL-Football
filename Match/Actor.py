class Actor(Player):
    '''
    The Actor class takes a Player object as an input when it initialises
    and uses the information in it to set up a fielding Actor which reflects
    the player it is based uponself.
    After the game the Actor will also be able to send information about changes
    to the Player object.

    Right now too little is nown about the Player class and the game itself to
    sufficiently build an Actor class.
